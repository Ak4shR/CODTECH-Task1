PROJECT: TEXT-TO-SPEECH CONVERSION APPLICATION
Objective:
The objective of the text-to-speech application task is to create a user-friendly tool that allows users to convert text input into spoken audio in multiple languages. This application aims to provide a seamless experience for users to generate high-quality speech output from entered text, facilitating communication and accessibility.

Key Activities:
Text Input Interface: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter to accept and display text input from users.
Language Selection: Implement functionality for users to choose from multiple languages (e.g., English, Hindi, French for this task) for speech synthesis.
Text Translation: Integrate translation capabilities to convert input text into the selected language using Google Translate or a similar service.
Speech Conversion: Utilize the gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library to convert translated text into audio files (MP3 format).
